<h2><strong>Recipe App</strong></h2>
To use you will have to sign up and get your own free api key, and update the Constants file under "recipeapp > business > domain > util" with your own app_id and app_key. I have disabled my api_key already so it will not work.

<h2><strong>About The App</strong></h2>
Features:<br>
<li>Ability to search recipes, save them to favorite, or add them and their ingredients to a shopping list.
<li>Shopping list keeps track of what ingredients you've checked even if you close the app.
<li>Search will automatically update and fill in the heart should you already have the recipe favorited.
<li>All 3 fragments UI are responsive and will update you accordingly if you save/delete recipes from another fragment. For example: If you delete a recipe by clicking the heart on Search Fragment, it will automatically remove it from the UI in Favorite Fragment.
